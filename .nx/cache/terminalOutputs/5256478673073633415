✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve "clsx"

    src/layout/Box.tsx:3:21:

        ╵                      ~~~~~~

  The Yarn Plug'n'Play manifest forbids importing "clsx" here because it's not listed as a dependency of this package:

    ../../../../.pnp.cjs:2669:31:

  You can mark the path "clsx" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which will remove this error.
